The malt is in the back seat for this one, as there is enough dark malt to give colour and a limited roasty flavour with no malt astringency. Black Lightning is hopped from the mash to the fermentor. We use Willamette, Chinook, Cascade, Summit and Centennial hops in very large volumes, about 100% more than a regular beer, but we don't make it too bitter. Black Lightning is 56 IBU and the water profile is adjusted to make the hops seem more rounded rather than sharp and harsh which can easily happen when using so much hops. 6.5% ABV",
